## Development
<details>
<summary>Environment Setup</summary>

To configure your development environment, copy the example environment file and make any necessary modifications to match your setup:

```bash
cp .env.dev.example .env
```

This file contains critical configurations, including database connections, plugins, and other essential environment variables.
</details>
<details>
<summary>Run the Dev Mode</summary>

For the first-time setup, you may need to build the Docker images before running the development environment:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d --build
```

This command builds and starts the necessary containers for AKVO-CKAN, including CKAN-dev, PostgreSQL, Redis, Solr, and other dependencies required for AKVO-CKAN to function in development mode.
